    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p> An eating plan that helps manage your weight includes a variety of healthy foods. 
        Add an array of colors to your plate and think of it as eating the rainbow. 
        Dark, leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes—even fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, 
        and minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to stews and omelets gives them a quick 
        and convenient boost of color and nutrients.

        <p>A balanced breakfast typically includes protein, fiber, and produce. While some people prefer to 
            skip breakfast, others need a source of energy to get going. If you enjoy breakfast, choosing 
            nutritious foods may provide long-lasting energy and keep you full for hours. These foods are 
            typically high in fiber, protein, healthy fats, and micronutrients.While it’s best to avoid 
            unhealthy options that are high in sugar, refined carbs, and additives, it’s not always easy to 
            know what to choose. As such, the list below will help you build a healthy breakfast.
